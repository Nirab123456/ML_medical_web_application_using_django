A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.  You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.  A function can return data as a result.  Creating a Function In Python a function is defined using the def keyword  ExampleGet your own Python Server def my_function   printHello from a function Calling a Function To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis  Example def my_function   printHello from a function  my_function Arguments Information can be passed into functions as arguments.  Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma.  The following example has a function with one argument fname. When the function is called, we pass along a first name, which is used inside the function to print the full name  Example def my_functionfname   printfname   Refsnes  my_functionEmil my_functionTobias my_function
