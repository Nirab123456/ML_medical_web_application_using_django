Canada is a vast and rugged land. From north to south it spans
more than half the Northern Hemisphere. From east to west it
stretches almost 4,700 miles (7,560 kilometers) across six time
zones. It is the second largest country in the world, but it has
only one-half of one percent of the world's population.

Canada features black-blue lakes, numerous rivers, majestic
western mountains, rolling central plains, and forested eastern
valleys. The Canadian Shield, a hilly region of lakes and
swamps, stretches across northern Canada and has some of
the oldest rocks on Earth.
