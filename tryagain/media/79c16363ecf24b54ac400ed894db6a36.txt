The Mughal Empire was an early modern empire based in South Asia between the 16th and 19th centuries.11 For some two hundred years, the empire stretched from the outer fringes of the Indus River Basin in the west, northern Afghanistan in the northwest, and Kashmir in the north, to the highlands of present-day Assam and Bangladesh in the east, and the uplands of the Deccan Plateau in South India.12  The Mughal Empire is conventionally said to have been founded in 1526 by Babur, a chieftain from what is today Uzbekistan, who employed aid from the neighboring Safavid and Ottoman Empires,13 to defeat the Sultan of Delhi, Ibrahim Lodi, in the First Battle of Panipat, and to sweep down the plains of North India. The Mughal imperial structure, however, is sometimes dated to 1600, to the rule of Baburs grandson, Akbar.14 This imperial structure lasted until 1720, until shortly after the death of Aurangzeb 1516. Aurangzebs campaign against Maratha Empire nominally increased the size of Mughal Empire, but failed to achieve its objective of conquering Maratha Empire, and had a ruinous effect on Mughal Army and Treasury 17. After Aurangzebs death, Marathas started conquest of Mughal Territories and became the dominant power in subcontinent 18. Reduced subsequently to the region in and around Old Delhi by 1760, the Mughal empire was formally dissolved by the British Raj after the Indian Rebellion of 1857.  Although the Mughal Empire was created and sustained by military warfare,192021 it did not vigorously suppress the cultures and peoples it came to rule rather it equalized and placated them through new administrative practices,2223 and diverse ruling elites, leading to more efficient, centralised, and standardized rule.24 The base of the empires collective wealth was agricultural taxes, instituted by the third Mughal emperor, Akbar.2526 These taxes, which amounted to well over half the output of a peasant cultivator,27 were paid in the well-regulated silver currency,24 and caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.28  The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in Indias economic expansion.29 The burgeoning European presence in the Indian Ocean and an increasing demand for Indian raw and finished products generated much wealth for the Mughal court.30 There was more conspicuous consumption among the Mughal elite,31 resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture, especially during the reign of Shah Jahan.32 Among the Mughal UNESCO World Heritage Sites in South Asia are Agra Fort, Fatehpur Sikri, Red Fort, Humayuns Tomb, Lahore Fort, Shalamar Gardens, and the Taj Mahal, which is described as the jewel of Muslim art in India, and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the worlds heritage.33
