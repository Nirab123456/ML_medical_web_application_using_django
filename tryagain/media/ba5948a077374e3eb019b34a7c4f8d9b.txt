The Mughal Empire was an early modern empire based in South Asia between the 16th and 19th centuries.11 For some two hundred years, the empire stretched from the outer fringes of the Indus River Basin in the west, northern Afghanistan in the northwest, and Kashmir in the north, to the highlands of present-day Assam and Bangladesh in the east, and the uplands of the Deccan Plateau in South India.12  The Mughal Empire is conventionally said to have been founded in 1526 by Babur, a chieftain from what is today Uzbekistan, who employed aid from the neighboring Safavid and Ottoman Empires,13 to defeat the Sultan of Delhi, Ibrahim Lodi, in the First Battle of Panipat, and to sweep down the plains of North India. The Mughal imperial structure, however, is sometimes dated to 1600, to the rule of Baburs grandson, Akbar.14 This imperial structure lasted until 1720, until shortly after the death of Aurangzeb 1516. Aurangzebs campaign against Maratha Empire nominally increased the size of Mughal Empire, but failed to achieve its objective of conquering Maratha Empire, and had a ruinous effect on Mughal Army and Treasury 17. After Aurangzebs death, Marathas started conquest of Mughal Territories and became the dominant power in subcontinent 18. Reduced subsequently to the region in and around Old Delhi by 1760, the Mughal empire was formally dissolved by the British Raj after the Indian Rebellion of 1857.
