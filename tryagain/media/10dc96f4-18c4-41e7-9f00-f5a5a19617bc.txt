Bangladesh forms the sovereign part of the historic and ethnolinguistic region of Bengal, which was divided
during the Partition of India in 1947.1"8 The country has a Bengali Muslim majority. Ancient Bengal was
known as Gangaridai and was a bastion of pre-Islamic kingdoms. Muslim conquests after 1204 heralded
the sultanate and Mughal periods, during which an independent Bengal Sultanate and a wealthy Mughal
Bengal transformed the region into an important centre of regional affairs, trade, and diplomacy. After 1757,
Bengal's administrative jurisdiction reached its greatest extent under the Bengal Presidency of the British
Empire. The creation of Eastern Bengal and Assam in 1905 set a precedent for the emergence of
Bangladesh. In 1940, the first Prime Minister of Bengal A. K. Fazlul Hug supported the Lahore Resolution.
Before the partition of Bengal, a Bengali sovereign state was first proposed by premier H. S. Suhrawardy. A
referendum and the announcement of the Radcliffe Line established the present-day territorial boundary of
Bangladesh.
