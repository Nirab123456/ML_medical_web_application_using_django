Your BMI result is not the perfect measure of your overall health. It can't tell if you're carrying too much fat or you've got a lot of muscle. You could use your BMI result as a starting point for further discussion with your GP. The adult BMI doesn't take into account age, sex or muscular build. This means that:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Older adults can have a healthy BMI but still have too much fat. This is because older adults tend to have more body fat than younger adults.</li>\n<li>Women can have a healthy BMI but still have too much fat. This is because women tend to have more body fat than men with the same BMI.</li>\n<li>If you're from a black and ethnic minority group, you're at increased risk of type 2 diabetes with a BMI of 23 or more.</li>\n<li> An athletic adult with a lot of muscle may have a high BMI but not be overweight. This is because BMI can’t tell the difference between fat and muscle.</li>\n</ul> \n\nTaking these limitations into account, the BMI is a relatively straightforward and convenient way of initially assessing someone's weight.\n\nIf you are pregnant, you should use your pre-pregnancy weight to work out your BMI.

For example, if you weigh 70kg (around 11 stone) and are 1.73m (around 5 feet 8 inches) tall, you work out your BMI by:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>squaring your height: 1.73x1.73 = 2.99</li>\n<li>dividing 70 (your weight) by 2.99 = 23.41</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Your result will be displayed to 1 decimal place, for example 23.4.</p>\n<p>We display your result on a chart showing your BMI in relation to a healthy BMI. There are 4 areas on the chart:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>underweight shown in red/yellow (below 18.5)</li>\n<li>healthy weight shown in green (18.5 to 24.9)</li>\n<li>overweight shown in yellow (25 to 29.9)</li>\n<li>obese shown in red (30 or over)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending on which area you’re in, we will give advice to help you reach or maintain a healthy weight. As well as weight and height, we also ask about your:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>age</li>\n<li>sex</li>\n<li>ethnicity</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This information helps us personalise your results.</p>\n<p>For children and young people aged 2 to 18 years old, BMI is given as a ‘centile’. The centile number shows how their BMI compares with other children of the same age and sex as a percentage. For example, a girl on the 75th centile is heavier than 75 out of 100 girls her age.</p>"}},"child_resources":{"A1":{"id":"A1","title":"How much activity should my child be doing?","copy":"Physical activity guidelines for children under 5","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/physical-activity-guidelines-children-under-five-years/","image":"A1.png","alt_text":"children running and playing together"},"A10":{"id":"A10","title":"Get into running with Couch to 5K","copy":"Download the Couch to 5K podcasts or app","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/couch-to-5k-week-by-week/","image":"A10.png","alt_text":"Couch to 5k logo"},"A11":{"id":"A11","title":"Get fit in 12 weeks","copy":"Follow this simple 12 week plan to get fit","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/12-week-fitness-plan/","image":"default.jpg","alt_text":"default image"},"A7":{"id":"A7","title":"Get active with your kids","copy":"Get moving with these family-friendly activities","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/change4life/activities/sports-and-activities","image":"A7.png","alt_text":"Family cycling together"},"A8":{"id":"A8","title":"Activity advice for young people","copy":"Physical activity guidelines for young people","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/physical-activity-guidelines-children-and-young-people/","image":"A8.png","alt_text":"Teenagers running on a track"},"A9":{"id":"A9","title":"Baby and toddler activity ideas","copy":"How to keep your baby or toddler active","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/keeping-kids-active/","image":"A9.png","alt_text":"Toddler playing football"},"E1":{"id":"E1","title":"What does healthy eating look like?","copy":"What to eat to achieve a healthy, balanced diet","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/the-eatwell-guide/","image":"E1.png","alt_text":"The Eatwell Guide image"},"E2":{"id":"E2","title":"Bring your child up to a health weight","copy":"All children need energy and nutrients from a varied and balanced diet","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-weight/underweight-children-2-5-advice-for-parents/","image":"E2.png","alt_text":"Young child drinking a glass of milk"},"E3":{"id":"E3","title":"Baby and toddler meal ideas","copy":"Inspiration to help cook healthy and tasty food for your kids","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/childrens-meal-ideas/","image":"E3.png","alt_text":"A child's lunchbox"},"E5":{"id":"E5","title":"Advice for underweight children","copy":"All children need energy and nutrients from a varied and balanced diet","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-weight/underweight-children-6-12-advice-for-parents/","image":"E5.png","alt_text":"A child looking at a single piece of broccoli"},"E7":{"id":"E7","title":"Fun ideas to help your kids stay healthy","copy":"Healthy, easy to cook meal ideas your kids will love","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/change4life/recipes","image":"E7.png","alt_text":"Roasted cheese and tomatoes on toast"},"E8":{"id":"E8","title":"What to feed young children","copy":"Handy tips on the different sorts of food to offer your child","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/understanding-food-groups/","image":"default.jpg","alt_text":"default image"},"G1":{"id":"G1","title":"Advice for underweight teen boys","copy":"Lots of boys don't reach their adult height and weight until they are over 18.","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-weight/underweight-teen-boys/","image":"G1.png","alt_text":"A half eaten apple and empty crisp packet"},"G2":{"id":"G2","title":"Worried you might be underweight?","copy":"Wondering if you're underweight?
