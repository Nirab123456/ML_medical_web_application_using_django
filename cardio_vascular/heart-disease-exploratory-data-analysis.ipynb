When dealing with imbalanced classes, this metric is useless. More informative metrics are precission,recall. Precision can be interpreted as the proportion of objects called positive by the classifier and at the same time are really positive, and recall shows what proportion of objects of a positive class out of all objects of a positive class the algorithm found. The balance between these two metrics is F1-score. It is the introduction of precision that does not allow us to write all objects into one class, since in this case we get an increase in the False Positive level. Recall demonstrates the algorithm's ability to detect a given class in general, while precision demonstrates the ability to distinguish this class from other classes. To solve our problem, you should choose the algorithm with the highest recall, but the choice of the final algorithm is up to you. It would be possible to search for the optimal hyperparameters of the model, but since Since the problem is exploratory in nature, we will leave the search for hyperparameters for competitions."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"FcnQQjHugf6_"},"source":["<a id=\"title-six\"></a>\n","<h1 style='background:#4682B4; border:2; border-radius: 10px; color:black'><center>RECOMENDATIONS</center></h1>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-AJgXAw-gqJe"},"source":["10 Essential Measures to Prevent Cardiovascular Disease\n","1. Healthy nutrition. The composition of the daily diet significantly affects the state of blood vessels and the heart. Frequent and excessive consumption of fatty and fried foods, coffee, chicken eggs, salt and sugar is a sure way to worsen the condition of blood vessels and develop heart attacks, strokes, hypertension and other dangerous ailments.\n","The increased content of saturated fats, caffeine, salt and sugar increases the level of \"bad\" cholesterol and blood sugar. Under their influence, atherosclerotic plaques that calcify over time are formed on the vascular walls. There is a narrowing of the lumen of the vessels, leading to their wear. This factor increases the load on the heart, arterial hypertension develops. Hypertension, in turn, leads to the development of many serious diseases that can lead to disability and death.\n","\n","2. Fighting excess weight. Obesity always increases the risk of vascular and heart pathologies - every extra 10 kg can increase blood pressure by 10-20 mm Hg. Art. All people need to be regularly weighed and have their abdominal circumference measured to determine abdominal obesity.\n","\n","3. Fight against physical inactivity. Hypodynamia is one of the common causes of diseases of the heart and blood vessels. This is confirmed by the facts about the low physical activity of citizens and the elderly. Remember! Physical activity should be appropriate for age and general health. Be sure to check with your doctor if you have any contraindications for physical education, and what loads are acceptable for you!\n","\n","4. Giving up bad habits. All studies on the effects of smoking, alcohol and drugs point to one indisputable fact - giving up these bad habits can reduce the risk of heart and vascular diseases by dozens of times. If you cannot get rid of addiction yourself, then to give up addictions, you should use the following methods: to quit smoking - acupuncture, nicotine patches or chewing gums, hypnosis;\n","to refuse alcohol or drug addiction - a course of treatment and rehabilitation by a professional narcologist.\n","5. Fighting stress. Frequent stressful situations lead to wear of blood vessels and myocardium. During nervous tension, the level of adrenaline rises. In response to its impact, the heart begins to beat faster, and the vessels are constricted by spasm. As a result, there is a jump in blood pressure, and the myocardium wears out much faster.\n","\n","6. Self-control of blood pressure and its timely reduction\n"," An increase in blood pressure leads to the development of coronary artery disease, heart attacks, strokes and other pathologies of the heart and blood vessels. That is why all people should regularly monitor pressure indicators.\n","\n","7. Systematic preventive examination. Scheduled preventive examination and timely visits to a cardiologist should become the norm for people at risk for the development of pathologies of the heart and blood vessels. The same applies to people who report an increase in blood pressure when measured independently. Do not neglect the recommendations of your doctor!\n","\n","\n","8. Controlling blood cholesterol levels\n","It is necessary to start annually to control the level of cholesterol in the blood after 30 years. In healthy people, its level should not exceed 5 mmol / l, and in patients with diabetes - 4-4.5 mmol / l.\n","\n","9. Blood sugar control\n","It is necessary to start monitoring blood sugar levels annually after 40-45 years. Its level should not exceed 3.3-5.5 mmol / l (in the blood from a finger), 4-6 mmol / l (in the blood from a vein).\n","\n","10. Taking blood thinners\n","For people at risk, a cardiologist may recommend taking blood thinners. The choice of the drug, its dose, the duration of the course of administration is determined only by the doctor, guided by the data of analyzes and other examinations.\n","\n","* Compliance with these rules for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases will significantly reduce the risk of their development.
